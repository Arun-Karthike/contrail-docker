[GLOBAL]
# All global configurations which would affect multiple sections or globally applicable configurations would be coming here.
#
# controller_ip - An IP address using which one can connect to all public services within controller container. This can be
#  a virtual IP handled by load balancer in case of multi-node controllers. This will be configured in various contrail
# services configurations to connect to other set of services like discovery_server_ip.
# controller_ip = 127.0.0.1
#
# controller_list - An array/list representation of controller server IP addresses - this will be used to configure rabbitmq, zookeeper,
# cassandra servers in various contrail service configurations and configure load balancer for variuos contrail services
# that needed to be loadbalanced
# controller_list = ["127.0.0.1"]
#
# analyticsdb_list - list of analyticsdb server IP addresses.
# analyticsdb_list = ["192.168.0.10"] ; IP Addresses on which cassandra is listening

[CASSANDRA]
# Cassandra version
# version =  2.2
# version_branch = 2.2
#
# Directory to store commitlogs. In case of any high performance disk mounted, it is prefered to use that for this
# commitlog_dir = /var/lib/cassandra/commitlog
#
# The directory location where table key and row caches are stored
# saved_caches_dir = /var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches
#
# data_dirs - A list of directory location where table data is stored (in SSTables). This is setup as list representation.
# Cassandra distributes data evenly across the location, subject to the granularity of the configured compaction strategy.
# data_dirs = ["/var/lib/cassandra/data"]
#
# listen_address - This must be an IP address - not 0.0.0.0
# listen_address = 192.168.0.10 ; Default is first found IP address on the machine

# JAVA memory configurations
# java_max_heap_size = 512M
